# Migrate Storybook

If you're using [Storybook 7.0](https://storybook.js.org/) for React with Webpack5, it's possible to use Rspack using an experimental [builder](https://storybook.js.org/docs/react/builders/overview).

## Updating dependencies

First, we need to add `@fy-dev/react-rspack` dependency, and uninstall the `@storybook/react-webpack5` dependency.

```diff title=package.json
{
  "dependencies": {
-   "@storybook/react-webpack5": "^7"
+   "@fy-dev/react-rspack": "latest"
  }}
```

## Configure Storybook

Then, make the corresponding change to the Storybook `main.js` config:

```diff title=.storybook/main.js
export default {
-  framework: '@storybook/react-webpack5'
+  framework: '@fy-dev/react-rspack'
}
```

## Limitations

Support for Storybook 7.0 is still experimental, and there are some limitations:

1. There is no docgen analysis for components to automatically generate controls,
2. There is no support for non-React frameworks,
3. There is no support for NextJS, which is its own framework
